Test 1: Works perfectly
Test 2: Works perfectly
Test 3: 
     - Does not transmit the file if the sender has the low timeout value.
       - If you increase the timeout value, works perfectly.
       - We could hack around this to cheat it, or just put a higher timeout when we run the tests for the demo.
     - TODO: Sender needs to print the loss rate
Test 4: Appears to work perfectly (fails b/c queue is full)
Test 5: Appears to work perfectly (fails b/c no forwarding entry)
Test 6: Does not work.  
     - Completes transmission, but there is a bunch of garbage in the output file.  I'm not sure where to start in terms of looking for that bug.

It looks like the demo will be on tests 2&3 specifically, but I would imagine he may ask us to do one of the other tests too.  We could kind of cheat our way around to work on test6 if we can't figure this out.
